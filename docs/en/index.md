# Rhino

Rhino is a customizable online platform for distributing educational and 
training content throughout organizations. It will be used for tracking the 
performance and engagement of individuals as they progress through the content.

The development for Rhino will serve two use cases. A package that is bundled 
together with organizations and run within their infrastructure (a single 
`RhinoAccount`) or existing websites. The second case is as a SaSS application 
hosted on `rhinoapp.io` which has just the one instance and separate 
`RhinoAccount` instances for each client.
