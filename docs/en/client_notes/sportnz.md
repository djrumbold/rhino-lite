# SportNZ

SportNZ commissioned Rhino for their Online Development Tool. For their 
configuration, Rhino is installed as an add-on for the existing website, 
a single account is setup and their users are setup as 'Teams'. Groups for their
context won't really be used. Users will either be a Team Member, or Team 
Leader. 

Each team can attempt all of the assignments.
