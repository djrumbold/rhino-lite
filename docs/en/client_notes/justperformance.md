# JustPerformance

Rhino was partly funded and written for JustPerformance as a product for them to take to their clients. For them, we'll
likely host an install at `rhino.dna.co.nz`, add an alias for `rhino.justperformance.co.nz` and then set them up with a
single `RhinoAccount` (see [datamodel](datamodel) for more details).

JustPerformance will then sell the tool to their clients and set each client up as an `RhinoGroup` under his 
master account. This allows JustPerformance to share content between all of their clients and have an overview of 
everyone.
